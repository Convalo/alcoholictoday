That means up to this very day, alcohol is legal. It has no Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule which makes it a controlled substance much like marijuana or cocaine.\r\n\r\nBooze is also plentiful, which means it’s always in stock.\r\n\r\nAnd booze is always in season. While one type of alcohol – say wine grapes might not be in season during winter, one is bound to find another kind of booze that can be more powerful than what’s out of season.\r\n\r\n### BOOZE IS STILL RELATIVELY CHEAP\r\n\r\nCompared to many other drugs, alcohol today is a downright steal. For the same amount as a gram of cocaine, an ample supply of liquor can be purchased.\r\n\r\n### ALCOHOL IS REGULATED\r\nWhether it’s whiskey, vodka or plain ol’ beer, only a certain amount of alcohol can be rendered with the substance.\r\nAdditionally, whether it be in a can or bottle, the alcohol contents have to be printed on the label.\r\n\r\n### ALCOHOL IS SAFER\r\nWell, at least to a certain extent, alcohol is safer because each bottle is printed with a manufacturer’s/distributor’s name on it. The contents of each bottle is processed the same, and the alcohol contents are regulated.\r\n\r\nOf course, this does not mean a person can’t or won’t overdose on alcohol. On the contrary, there have been many cases of alcohol overindulgence, which has led to passing out, upwards to seizure, stroke, organ failure and finally death.\r\n\r\n\r\nSure, alcohol today might be the most popular drug available. But that is due in part to accessibility as well as legal status.\r\n\r\nOf course, its societal status that makes booze popular.\r\n\r\nAnd because alcohol can have inroads into a family atmosphere, this doesn’t make booze any less dangerous or addictive. Just because your parents drink – and sometimes to an excess, does not make alcohol any less dangerous, addictive or even illegal if found in the possession of a minor \r\n\r\nIn short, alcohol is no less addictive, or ultimately less deadly than any other drug currently available to the public. \r\n\r\nAlcohol is everywhere. It’s even in our own houses. And though it is possible to cull a house down to a level of pure sobriety, there is life outside the house where alcohol exists in droves.\r\n\r\nBe careful of where alcohol exists in droves. Remain cautious and vigilant.\r\n\r\nEven if booze isn’t the hippest drug around, it still holds danger for those who choose to imbibe far too much and too often with alcohol.",
