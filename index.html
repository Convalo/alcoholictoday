<a id="the-popularity-continues" class="anchor" href="#the-popularity-continues" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>THE POPULARITY CONTINUES</h2>

<p>You would think that with so many available drugs of choice (or drugs that could be your choice), that alcohol would have taken a back seat sooner or later to a hipper substance.</p>

<p>After all, with the influx of prescription painkillers, amphetamines to help with concentration, long-standing narcotics and other drugs easily found in a parents’ medicine cabinet as well as on the street, booze, which takes more work to access, should be farther down the casual drug use totem pole.</p>

<p>Even weed is an easier substance to net than a sixer of Pabst or a fifth of Early Times.</p>

<p>But despite these “also ran” drugs, alcohol is still at the top as far as popularity is concerned.</p>

<p>Even so, the question remains: why is alcohol number one, even in lieu of less expensive yet more powerful drugs? </p>

<h3>
<a id="booze-is-legal" class="anchor" href="#booze-is-legal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BOOZE IS LEGAL</h3>

<p>Prohibition is long gone – almost a century gone. That means up to this very day, alcohol is legal. It has no Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule which makes it a controlled substance much like marijuana or cocaine.</p>

<p>Booze is also plentiful, which means it’s always in stock.</p>

<p>And booze is always in season. While one type of alcohol – say wine grapes might not be in season during winter, one is bound to find another kind of booze that can be more powerful than what’s out of season.</p>

<h3>
<a id="booze-is-still-relatively-cheap" class="anchor" href="#booze-is-still-relatively-cheap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BOOZE IS STILL RELATIVELY CHEAP</h3>

<p>Compared to many other drugs, alcohol today is a downright steal. For the same amount as a gram of cocaine, an ample supply of liquor can be purchased.</p>

<h3>
<a id="alcohol-is-regulated" class="anchor" href="#alcohol-is-regulated" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ALCOHOL IS REGULATED</h3>

<p>Whether it’s whiskey, vodka or plain ol’ beer, only a certain amount of alcohol can be rendered with the substance.
Additionally, whether it be in a can or bottle, the alcohol contents have to be printed on the label.</p>

<h3>
<a id="alcohol-is-safer" class="anchor" href="#alcohol-is-safer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ALCOHOL IS SAFER</h3>

<p>Well, at least to a certain extent, alcohol is safer because each bottle is printed with a manufacturer’s/distributor’s name on it. The contents of each bottle is processed the same, and the alcohol contents are regulated.</p>

<p>Of course, this does not mean a person can’t or won’t overdose on alcohol. On the contrary, there have been many cases of alcohol overindulgence, which has led to passing out, upwards to seizure, stroke, organ failure and finally death.</p>

<p>Sure, alcohol today might be the most popular drug available. But that is due in part to accessibility as well as legal status.</p>

<p>Of course, its societal status that makes booze popular.</p>

<p>And because alcohol can have inroads into a family atmosphere, this doesn’t make booze any less dangerous or addictive. Just because your parents drink – and sometimes to an excess, does not make alcohol any less dangerous, addictive or even illegal if found in the possession of a minor </p>

<p>In short, alcohol is no less addictive, or ultimately less deadly than any other drug currently available to the public. </p>

<p>Alcohol is everywhere. It’s even in our own houses. And though it is possible to cull a house down to a level of pure sobriety, there is life outside the house where alcohol exists in droves.</p>

<p>Be careful of where alcohol exists in droves. Remain cautious and vigilant.</p>

<p>Even if booze isn’t the hippest drug around, it still holds danger for those who choose to imbibe far too much and too often with alcohol.</p>
